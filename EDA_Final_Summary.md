## ***The following things can be done to help retain customers:***

1. As customers tend to churn in the initial months of their tenure, we should remove the month-to-month type contract.
2. We should keep the minimum contract length as 6 months as the churn rate drops considerably after that period.
3. We should remove Electronic check as a mode of payment as most customers who use it churn indicating that they hate that service
4. Also the quality of Fiber Optic Internet Service should be improved as customers opting for it churn in higher numbers compared to other internet services. 
5. If not possible to improve then the fiber optic service should be removed.
6. We should make Online Security a mandatory service for customers who opt for any Internet Service.
7. We should make it necessary for customers to opt for atleast 1 Online Service as most who have not opted for any Online Service tend to churn.
